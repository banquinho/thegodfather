There is a moment\\'s hesitation, and then the\\n\\tsimple words in white lettering:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  THE GODFATHER\\n\\n\\tWhile this remains, we hear: \"I believe in America.\"\\n\\tSuddenly we are watching in CLOSE VIEW, AMERIGO BONASERA, a\\n\\tman of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great\\n\\temotion.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tAmerica has made my fortune.\\n\\n\\tAs he speaks, THE VIEW imperceptibly begins to loosen.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tI raised my daughter in the American\\n\\t\\tfashion; I gave her freedom, but\\n\\t\\ttaught her never to dishonor her\\n\\t\\tfamily.  She found a boy friend,\\n\\t\\tnot an Italian.  She went to the\\n\\t\\tmovies with him, stayed out late.\\n\\t\\tTwo months ago he took her for a\\n\\t\\tdrive, with another boy friend.\\n\\t\\tThey made her drink whiskey and\\n\\t\\tthen they tried to take advantage\\n\\t\\tof her.  She resisted; she kept her\\n\\t\\thonor.  So they beat her like an\\n\\t\\tanimal.  When I went to the hospital\\n\\t\\ther nose was broken, her jaw was\\n\\t\\tshattered and held together by\\n\\t\\twire, and she could not even weep\\n\\t\\tbecause of the pain.\\n\\n\\tHe can barely speak; he is weeping now.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tI went to the Police like a good\\n\\t\\tAmerican.  These two boys were\\n\\t\\tarrested and brought to trial.  The\\n\\t\\tjudge sentenced them to three years\\n\\t\\tin prison, and suspended the\\n\\t\\tsentence.  Suspended sentence!\\n\\t\\tThey went free that very day.  I\\n\\t\\tstood in the courtroom like a fool,\\n\\t\\tand those bastards, they smiled at\\n\\t\\tme.  Then I said to my wife, for\\n\\t\\tJustice, we must go to The Godfather.\\n\\n\\tBy now, THE VIEW is full, and we see Don Corleone\\'s office\\n\\tin his home.\\n\\n\\tThe blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with\\n\\tpatterned shadows.  We are watching BONASERA over the\\n\\tshoulder of DON CORLEONE.  TOM HAGEN sits near a small\\n\\ttable, examining some paperwork, and SONNY CORLEONE stands\\n\\timpatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a\\n\\tglass of wine.  We can HEAR music, and the laughter and\\n\\tvoices of many people outside.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tBonasera, we know each other for\\n\\t\\tyears, but this is the first time\\n\\t\\tyou come to me for help.  I don\\'t\\n\\t\\tremember the last time you invited\\n\\t\\tme to your house for coffee...even\\n\\t\\tthough our wives are friends.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tWhat do you want of me?  I\\'ll give\\n\\t\\tyou anything you want, but do what\\n\\t\\tI ask!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tAnd what is that Bonasera?\\n\\n\\tBONASERA whispers into the DON\\'s ear.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tNo.  You ask for too much.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tI ask for Justice.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tThe Court gave you justice.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tAn eye for an eye!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tBut your daughter is still alive.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tThen make them suffer as she\\n\\t\\tsuffers.  How much shall I pay you.\\n\\n\\tBoth HAGEN and SONNY react.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tYou never think to protect yourself\\n\\t\\twith real friends.  You think it\\'s\\n\\t\\tenough to be an American.  All\\n\\t\\tright, the Police protects you,\\n\\t\\tthere are Courts of Law, so you\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t need a friend like me.\\n\\t\\tBut now you come to me and say Don\\n\\t\\tCorleone, you must give me justice.\\n\\t\\tAnd you don\\'t ask in respect or\\n\\t\\tfriendship.  And you don\\'t think to\\n\\t\\tcall me Godfather; instead you come\\n\\t\\tto my house on the day my daughter\\n\\t\\tis to be married and you ask me to\\n\\t\\tdo murder...for money.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tAmerica has been good to me...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tThen take the justice from the\\n\\t\\tjudge, the bitter with the sweet,\\n\\t\\tBonasera.  But if you come to me\\n\\t\\twith your friendship, your loyalty,\\n\\t\\tthen your enemies become my enemies,\\n\\t\\tand then, believe me, they would\\n\\t\\tfear you...\\n\\n\\tSlowly, Bonasera bows his head and murmurs.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBONASERA\\n\\t\\tBe my friend.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tGood.

They in turn carry\\n\\twith them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked\\n\\tbread and pastries, and enormous trays of Italian delicacies.\\n\\n\\tThe entire family poses for a family portrait: DON CORLEONE,\\n\\tMAMA, SONNY, his wife, SANDRA, and their children, TOM HAGEN\\n\\tand his wife, THERESA, and their BABY; CONSTANZIA, the\\n\\tbride, and her bridegroom, CARLO RIZZI.  As they move into\\n\\tthe pose, THE DON seems preoccupied.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWhere\\'s Michael?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tHe\\'ll be here Pop, it\\'s still early.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tThen the picture will wait for him.\\n\\n\\tEveryone in the group feels the uneasiness as the DON moves\\n\\tback to the house.  SONNY gives a delicious smile in the\\n\\tdirection of the Maid-of-Honor, LUCY MANCINI.  She returns\\n\\tit.  Then he moves to his wife.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tSandra, watch the kids.  They\\'re\\n\\t\\trunning wild.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSANDRA\\n\\t\\tYou watch yourself.\\n\\n\\tHAGEN kisses his WIFE, and follows THE DON, passing the wine\\n\\tbarrels, where a group of FOUR MEN nervously wait.  TOM\\n\\tcrooks a finger at NAZORINE, who doublechecks that he is\\n\\tnext, straightens, and follows HAGEN.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: MALL ENTRANCE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tOutside the main gate of the Mall, SEVERAL MEN in suits,\\n\\tworking together with a MAN in a dark sedan, walk in and out\\n\\tof the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers\\n\\tdown in their notebooks.

Put another\\n\\tnumber in the notebook.\\n\\n\\tTESSIO, a tall, gentle-looking man, dances with a NINE-YEAR-\\n\\tOLD GIRL, her little black party shoes planted on his\\n\\tenormous brown shoes.\\n\\n\\tThe MEN move on to other parked cars, when SONNY storms out\\n\\tof the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by\\n\\tCLEMENZA and PAULIE.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tBuddy, this is a private party.\\n\\n\\tThe MAN doesn\\'t answer, but points to the DRIVER of the\\n\\tsedan.  SONNY menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him.\\n\\tThe DRIVER merely flips open his wallet to a greed card,\\n\\twithout saying a word.  SONNY steps back, spits on the\\n\\tground, turns, and walks away, followed by CLEMENZA, PAULIE,\\n\\tand another TWO MEN.  He doesn\\'t say a thing for most of the\\n\\twalk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to PAULIE.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tGoddamn FBI...don\\'t respect nothing.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: DON\\'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tDON CORLEONE sits quietly behind his massive desk in the\\n\\tdark study.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNAZORINE\\n\\t\\t...a fine boy from Sicily, captured\\n\\t\\tby the American Army, and sent to\\n\\t\\tNew Jersey as a prisoner of war...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tNazorine, my friend, tell me what I\\n\\t\\tcan do.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNAZORINE\\n\\t\\tNow that the war is over, Enzo,\\n\\t\\tthis boy is being repatriated to\\n\\t\\tItaly.

Turns to HAGEN.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWhen does my daughter leave with\\n\\t\\ther bridegroom?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tThey\\'ll cut the cake in a few\\n\\t\\tminutes...leave right after that.\\n\\t\\tYour new son-in-law, do we give him\\n\\t\\tsomething important?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tNo, give him a living.  But never\\n\\t\\tlet him know the family\\'s business.\\n\\t\\tWhat else, Tom?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve called the hospital; they\\'ve\\n\\t\\tnotified Consiglere Genco\\'s family\\n\\t\\tto come and wait.  He won\\'t last\\n\\t\\tout the night.\\n\\n\\tThis saddens the DON.  He sighs.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tGenco will wait for me.  Santino,\\n\\t\\ttell your brothers they will come\\n\\t\\twith me to the hospital to see\\n\\t\\tGenco.

The CROWD is favorably impressed: they\\n\\tbegin to clink their knives or forks against their glasses,\\n\\tin the traditional request for the Bride to cut the cake and\\n\\tkiss the Groom.  Louder and louder, five hundred forks\\n\\thitting five hundred glasses.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: MALL (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tSilence.\\n\\n\\tHIGH ANGLE ON THE MALL, late day.  The GUESTS are gone.  A\\n\\tsingle black car is in the courtyard.  FREDDIE is behind the\\n\\tdriver\\'s seat: the DON enters the car, looks at MICHAEL, who\\n\\tsits between SONNY and JOHNNY in the rear seat.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWill your girl friend get back to\\n\\t\\tthe city all right?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tTom said he\\'d take care of it.\\n\\n\\tThe DON pulls the door shut; and the car pulls out, through\\n\\tthe gate of the great Corleone Mall.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tA long white hospital corridor, at the end of which we can\\n\\tsee a grouping of FIVE WOMEN, some old and some young, but\\n\\tall plump and dressed in black.\\n\\n\\tDON CORLEONE and his SONS move toward the end.  But then the\\n\\tDON slows, putting his hand on MICHAEL\\'s shoulder.  MICHAEL\\n\\tstops and turns toward his FATHER.  The two looks at one\\n\\tanother for some time.  SILENCE.  DON CORLEONE then lifts\\n\\this hand, and slowly touches a particular medal on MICHAEL\\'s\\n\\tuniform.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWhat was this for?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tFor bravery.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tAnd this?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tFor killing a man.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWhat miracles you do for strangers.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tI fought for my country.  It was my\\n\\t\\tchoice.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tAnd now, what do you choose to do?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tI\\'m going to finish school.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tGood.  When you are finished, come\\n\\t\\tand talk to me.  I have hopes for\\n\\t\\tyou.\\n\\n\\tAgain they regard each other without a word.  MICHAEL turns,\\n\\tand continues on.  DON CORLEONE watches a moment, and then\\n\\tfollows.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: HOSPITAL ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tDON CORLEONE enters the hospital room, moving closest to OUR\\n\\tVIEW.  He is followed by his SONS, JOHNNY and the WOMEN.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\t\\t  (whispered)\\n\\t\\tGenco, I\\'ve brought my sons to pay\\n\\t\\ttheir respects.  And look, even\\n\\t\\tJohnny Fontane, all the way from\\n\\t\\tHollywood.\\n\\n\\tGENCO is a tiny, wasted skeleton of a man.  DON CORLEONE\\n\\ttakes his bony hand, as the others arrange themselves around\\n\\this bed, each clasping the other hand in turn.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGENCO\\n\\t\\tGodfather, Godfather, it\\'s your\\n\\t\\tdaughter\\'s wedding day, you cannot\\n\\t\\trefuse me.  Cure me, you have the\\n\\t\\tpower.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tI have no such power...but Genco,\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t fear death.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGENCO\\n\\t\\t\\t  (with a sly wink)\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s been arranged, then?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tYou blaspheme.  Resign yourself.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGENCO\\n\\t\\tYou need your old Consigliere.  Who\\n\\t\\twill replace me?\\n\\t\\t\\t  (suddenly)\\n\\t\\tStay with me Godfather.  Help me\\n\\t\\tmeet death.  If he sees you, he\\n\\t\\twill be frightened and leave me in\\n\\t\\tpeace.  You can say a word, pull a\\n\\t\\tfew strings, eh?  We\\'ll outwit that\\n\\t\\tbastard as we outwitted all those\\n\\t\\tothers.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (clutching his hand)\\n\\t\\tGodfather, don\\'t betray me.\\n\\n\\tThe DON motions all the others to leave the room.  They do.\\n\\tHe returns his attention to GENCO, holding his hand and\\n\\twhispering things we cannot hear, as they wait for death.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tFADE IN:\\n\\n\\tThe interior of a non-stop Constellation.  HAGEN is one of\\n\\tthe very few passengers on this late flight.  He looks like\\n\\tany young lawyer on a business trip.  He is tired from the\\n\\tdifficult preparation and duties that he has just executed\\n\\tduring the wedding.  On the seat next to him is an enormous,\\n\\tbulging briefcase.  He closes his eyes.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: HONEYMOON HOTEL (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tThe honeymoon hotel: CARLO and CONNIE.  CARLO is in his\\n\\tundershorts, sitting up on the bed, anxiously taking the\\n\\tenvelopes out of the silk bridal purse and counting the\\n\\tcontents.  CONNIE prepares herself in the large marble\\n\\tbathroom.  She rubs her hands over his bronze shoulders, and\\n\\ttries to get his interest.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: DON\\'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tDON CORLEONE in his office.  LUCA BRASI sitting near to him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tLuca, I am worried about this man\\n\\t\\tSollozzo.  Find out what you can,\\n\\t\\tthrough the Tattaglias.  Let them\\n\\t\\tbelieve you could be tempted away\\n\\t\\tfrom the Corleone Family, if the\\n\\t\\tright offer was made.  Learn what\\n\\t\\the has under his fingernails...\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: MANCINI APT. HALL (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tThe hallway of an apartment building.  SONNY enters, climbs\\n\\ttwo steps at a time.  He knocks, and then whispers.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s me, Sonny.\\n\\n\\tThe door opens, and two lovely arms are around him, pulling\\n\\thim into the apartment.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: LUCA\\'S ROOM (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tLUCA BRASI\\'s tiny room.  He is partly dressed.  He kneels\\n\\tand reaches under his bed and pulls out a small, locked\\n\\ttrunk.  He opens it, and takes out a heavy, bullet-proof\\n\\tvest.  He puts it on, over his wool undershirt, and then\\n\\tputs on his shirt and jacket.  He takes his gun, quickly\\n\\tdisassembles, checks, and reassembles it.  And leaves.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: DON\\'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tA CLOSE VIEW of DON CORLEONE thinking quietly.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: MOVING TRAIN (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL and KAY on a train, speeding on their way to New\\n\\tHampshire.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: SUBWAY (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tLUCA, in his bulky jacket, sitting quietly on an empty\\n\\tsubway train.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: AIRPLANE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tHAGEN on the Constellation.  He reaches into his briefcase,\\n\\tand takes out several pictures and papers.\\n\\n\\tOne photograph is of a smiling man, JACK WOLTZ, linked arm\\n\\tin arm with fifteen movie stars on either side, including a\\n\\tlovely young child star to his immediate right.\\n\\n\\tHAGEN considers other papers.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: DON\\'S OFFICE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tDON CORLEONE looks, and then moves HAGEN into an embrace.\\n\\tHe straightens his arms and looks at TOM deeply.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tRemember my new Consigliere, a\\n\\t\\tlawyer with his briefcase can steal\\n\\t\\tmore than a hundred men with guns.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: WOLTZ ESTATE GATE (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tJACK WOLTZ ESTATE.  HAGEN stands before the impressive gate,\\n\\tarmed only with his briefcase.  A GATEMAN opens the gate,\\n\\tand TOM enters.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: WOLTZ GARDENS (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tHAGEN and WOLTZ comfortably stroll along beautiful formal\\n\\tgardens, martinis in hand.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWOLTZ\\n\\t\\tYou should have told me your boss\\n\\t\\twas Corleone, Tom, I had to check\\n\\t\\tyou out.  I thought you were just\\n\\t\\tsome third rate hustler Johnny was\\n\\t\\trunning in to bluff me.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (a piece of statuary)\\n\\t\\tFlorence, thirteenth century.\\n\\t\\tDecorated the garden of a king.\\n\\n\\tThey cross the garden and head toward the stables.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWOLTZ\\n\\t\\tI\\'m going to show you something\\n\\t\\tbeautiful.\\n\\n\\tThey pass the stables, and come to rest by a stall with a\\n\\thuge bronze plaque attached to the outside wall: \"KHARTOUM.\"\\n\\tTWO SECURITY GUARDS are positioned in chairs nearby; they\\n\\trise as WOLTZ approaches.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWOLTZ\\n\\t\\tYou like horses?  I like horses, I\\n\\t\\tlove \\'em.  Beautiful, expensive\\n\\t\\tRacehorses.\\n\\n\\tThe animal inside is truly beautiful.  WOLTZ whispers to him\\n\\twith true love in his voice.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWOLTZ\\n\\t\\tKhartoum...Kartoum...You are\\n\\t\\tlooking at six hundred thousand\\n\\t\\tdollars on four hoofs.  I bet even\\n\\t\\tRussian Czars never paid that kind\\n\\t\\tof dough for a single horse.  But\\n\\t\\tI\\'m not going to race him I\\'m going\\n\\t\\tto put him out to Stud.\\n\\n\\tINT NIGHT: WOLTZ DINING ROOM (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tHAGEN and WOLTZ sit at an enormous dining room table,\\n\\tattended by SEVERAL SERVANTS.  Great paintings hang on the\\n\\twalls.  The meal is elaborate and sumptuous.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tMr. Corleone is Johnny\\'s Godfather.\\n\\t\\tThat is very close, a very sacred\\n\\t\\treligious relationship.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWOLTZ\\n\\t\\tOkay, but just tell him this is one\\n\\t\\tfavor I can\\'t give.  But he should\\n\\t\\ttry me again on anything else.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tHe never asks a second favor when\\n\\t\\the has been refused the first.\\n\\t\\tUnderstood?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWOLTZ\\n\\t\\tYou smooth son of a bitch, let me\\n\\t\\tlay it on the line for you, and\\n\\t\\tyour boss.  Johnny Fontane never\\n\\t\\tgets that movie.  I don\\'t care how\\n\\t\\tmany Dago, Guinea, wop Greaseball\\n\\t\\tGoombahs come out of the woodwork!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tI\\'m German-Irish.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWOLTZ\\n\\t\\tOkay my Kraut-Mick friend, Johnny\\n\\t\\twill never get that part because I\\n\\t\\thate that pinko punk and I\\'m going\\n\\t\\tto run him out of the Movies.  And\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll tell you why.  He ruined one\\n\\t\\tof Woltz Brothers\\' most valuable\\n\\t\\tproteges.  For five years I had\\n\\t\\tthis girl under training; singing\\n\\t\\tlessons!  Acting lessons!  Dancing\\n\\t\\tlessons!  We spent hundreds of\\n\\t\\tthousands of dollars--I was going\\n\\t\\tto make her a star.  I\\'ll be even\\n\\t\\tmore frank, just to show you that\\n\\t\\tI\\'m not a hard-hearted man, that it\\n\\t\\twasn\\'t all dollars and cents.  That\\n\\t\\tgirl was beautiful and young and\\n\\t\\tinnocent and she was the greatest\\n\\t\\tpiece of ass I\\'ve ever ad and I\\'ve\\n\\t\\thad them all over the world.  Then\\n\\t\\tJohnny comes along with that olive\\n\\t\\toil voice and guinea charm and she\\n\\t\\truns off.  She threw it all away to\\n\\t\\tmake me look ridiculous.  A MAN IN\\n\\t\\tMY POSITION CANNOT AFFORD TO BE\\n\\t\\tMADE TO LOOK RIDICULOUS!\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: GENCO OLIVE OIL CO. (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tAn unimposing little building in New York City on Mott\\n\\tStreet with a large old sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL IMPORTS,\\n\\tINC.\" next to an open-faced fruit market.\\n\\n\\tA dark Buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we\\n\\tcannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters\\n\\tthe building.  This is VIRGIL SOLLOZZO.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tLooking toward the staircase we can hear SOLLOZZO\\'s footsteps\\n\\tbefore he actually rises into view.  He is a small man, very\\n\\tdark, with curly black hair.  But wiry, and tight and hard,\\n\\tand obviously very dangerous.  He is greeted at the head of\\n\\tthe stairs by SONNY, who takes his hand and shakes it,\\n\\tintroducing himself.  For a moment, there is a complex of\\n\\thandshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful\\n\\tintroductions.  Finally, SOLLOZZO is taken into the DON\\'s\\n\\tglass paneled office; the two principals are introduced.\\n\\tThey are very respectful of one another.  Folding chairs are\\n\\tbrought in by FREDDIE, and soon they are all sitting around\\n\\tin a circle; the DON, SOLLOZZO, SONNY, HAGEN, FREDDIE,\\n\\tCLEMENZA and TESSIO.  The DON is the slightest bit foolish\\n\\twith all his compatriots, whereas SOLLOZZO has brought no\\n\\tone.  Throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear\\n\\tthat this scene is between two men: SOLLOZZO and DON CORLEONE.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tMy business is heroin, I have poppy\\n\\t\\tfields, laboratories in Narseilles\\n\\t\\tand Sicily, ready to go into\\n\\t\\tproduction.  My importing methods\\n\\t\\tare as safe as these things can be,\\n\\t\\tabout five per cent loss.  The risk\\n\\t\\tis nothing, the profits enormous.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWhy do you come to me?  Why do I\\n\\t\\tdeserve your generosity?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tI need two million dollars in\\n\\t\\tcash...more important, I need a\\n\\t\\tfriend who has people in high\\n\\t\\tplaces; a friend who can guarantee\\n\\t\\tthat if one of my employees be\\n\\t\\tarrested, they would get only light\\n\\t\\tsentences.  Be my friend.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWhat percentages for my family?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tThirty per cent.  In the first year\\n\\t\\tyour share would be four million\\n\\t\\tdollars; then it would go up.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tAnd what is the percentage of the\\n\\t\\tTattaglia family?\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO nods toward HAGEN.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tMy compliments.  I\\'ll take care of\\n\\t\\tthem from my share.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tSo.  I receive 30 per cent just for\\n\\t\\tfinance and legal protection.  No\\n\\t\\tworries about operations, is that\\n\\t\\twhat you tell me?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tIf you think two million dollars in\\n\\t\\tcash is just finance, I congratulate\\n\\t\\tyou Don Corleone.\\n\\n\\tThere is a long silence; in which each person present feels\\n\\tthe tension.  The DON is about to give his answer.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tI said I would see you because I\\'ve\\n\\t\\theard you\\'re a serious man, to be\\n\\t\\ttreated with respect...\\n\\t\\t\\t  (pause)\\n\\t\\tBut I\\'ll say no to you.\\n\\n\\tWe feel this around the room.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll give you my reasons.  I have\\n\\t\\tmany, many friends in Politics.\\n\\t\\tBut they wouldn\\'t be so friendly if\\n\\t\\tmy business was narcotics instead\\n\\t\\tof gambling.  They think gambling\\n\\t\\tis something like liquor, a harmless\\n\\t\\tvice...and they think narcotics is\\n\\t\\tdirty business.\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO takes a breath.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tNo...how a man makes his living is\\n\\t\\tnone of my business.  But this\\n\\t\\tproposition of yours is too risky.\\n\\t\\tAll the people in my family lived\\n\\t\\twell the last ten years, I won\\'t\\n\\t\\trisk that out of greed.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tAre you worried about security for\\n\\t\\tyour million?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tNo.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tThe Tattaglias will guarantee your\\n\\t\\tinvestment also.\\n\\n\\tThis startles SONNY; he blurts out.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tThe Tattaglia family guarantees our\\n\\t\\tinvestment?\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face\\n\\thim.  Everyone is the room knows that SONNY has stepped out\\n\\tof line.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tYoung people are greedy, and they\\n\\t\\thave no manners.  They speak when\\n\\t\\tthey should listen.  But I have a\\n\\t\\tsentimental weakness for my\\n\\t\\tchildren, and I\\'ve spoiled them, as\\n\\t\\tyou see.  But Signor Sollozzo, my\\n\\t\\tno is final.\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO nods, understands that this is the dismissal.  He\\n\\tglances one last time at SONNY.  He rises; all the others do\\n\\tas well.  He bows to the DON, shakes his hand, and formally\\n\\ttakes his leave.  When the footsteps can no longer be heard:\\n\\n\\tThe DON turns to SONNY.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tSantino, never let anyone outside\\n\\t\\tthe family know what you are\\n\\t\\tthinking.  I think your brain is\\n\\t\\tgoing soft from all that comedy you\\n\\t\\tplay with that young girl.\\n\\n\\tTWO OFFICE WORKERS are carrying an enormous floral display\\n\\twith the word \"THANK YOU\" spelled out in flowers.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tWhat is this nonsense?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s from Johnny.  It was announced\\n\\t\\tthis morning.  He\\'s going to play\\n\\t\\tthe lead in the new Woltz Brothers\\n\\t\\tfilm.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: WOLTZ\\'S BEDROOM (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tIt is large, dominated by a huge bed, in which a man,\\n\\tpresumably WOLTZ, is sleeping.  Soft light bathes the room\\n\\tfrom the large windows.  We move closer to him until we see\\n\\this face, and recognize JACK WOLTZ.  He turns uncomfortably;\\n\\tmutters, feels something strange in his bedsheets.  Something\\n\\twet.\\n\\n\\tHe wakens, feels the sheets with displeasure; they are wet.\\n\\tHe looks at his hand; the wetness is blood.  He is\\n\\tfrightened, pulls aside the covers, and sees fresh blood on\\n\\this sheets and pajamas.  He grunts, pulls the puddle of\\n\\tblood in his bed.  He feels his own body frantically,\\n\\tmoving, down, following the blood, until he is face to face\\n\\twith the great severed head of Khartoum lying at the foot of\\n\\this bed.  Just blood from the hacked neck.  White reedy\\n\\ttendons show.  He struggles up to his elbows in the puddle\\n\\tof blood to see more clearly.  Froth covers the muzzle, and\\n\\tthe enormous eyes of the animal are yellowed and covered\\n\\twith blood.\\n\\n\\tWOLTZ tries to scream; but cannot.  No sound comes out.\\n\\tThen, finally and suddenly an ear-splitting scream of pure\\n\\tterror escapes from WOLTZ, who is rocking on his hands and\\n\\tknees in an uncontrolled fit, blood all over him.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: OLIVE OIL OFFICES (SUMMER 1945)\\n\\n\\tCLOSE VIEW on the GODFATHER.  Nodding.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tSend Johnny my congratulations.\\n\\n\\t----------------------------------------FADE OUT--------\\n\\n\\t(SCENES 12 & 12 OMITTED)\\n\\n\\tFADE IN:\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: FIFTH AVENUE (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tFifth Avenue in the snow.

In the background,\\n\\tthrough the glass partitions, we can see the DON, at work in\\n\\this office.  TOM is tired, and steeped in paperwork.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN (O.S.)\\n\\t\\tSure.

There are rows of\\n\\tpleasant houses; driveway after driveway, down the block.  A\\n\\tdark, somber young man of thirty-one or two walks with a\\n\\tnoticeable limp down the sidewalk, and rings the bell.  This\\n\\tis ROCCO LAMPONE.  The woman of the house, MRS. CLEMENZA,\\n\\ttalks to him through the screen door, and then points to the\\n\\tside of the house.  ROCCO moves to the garage, which is\\n\\tspecially heated, and in which CLEMENZA is busy at work\\n\\twashing a shiny brand new Lincoln.  LAMPONE admires the car.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLAMPONE\\n\\t\\tNice.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCLEMENZA\\n\\t\\tCrazy Detroit delivered it with a\\n\\t\\twooden bumper.

All we hear are\\n\\this sole footsteps.\\n\\n\\tHe walks up to a desk marked \"INFORMATION\".  No one is there.\\n\\tHe moves quickly to a door marked \"OFFICE\"; swings into it;\\n\\tno one is there.  He looks onto the desk:  There is half a\\n\\tsandwich, and a half-filled bottle of coke.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tHello?  Hello?\\n\\n\\tNow he knows something is happening, he moves quickly,\\n\\talertly.  MICHAEL walking down the hospital corridors; all\\n\\talone.  The floors have just been mopped.  They are still wet.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: HOSPITAL STAIRS\\n\\n\\tNow he turns onto a staircase; ever quickening; up several\\n\\tflights.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR CORRIDOR\\n\\n\\tHe steps out onto the fourth floor.  He looks.  There are\\n\\tmerely empty corridors.  He takes out his scrap of paper;\\n\\tchecks it.  \"Room 4A.\"  Now he hurries, trying to follow the\\n\\tcode of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker\\n\\tand quicker they flash by him.  Now he stops, looks up \"4A--\\n\\tCorleone\".\\n\\n\\tThere is a special card table set up there with some\\n\\tmagazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the\\n\\tashtray--but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: DON\\'S ROOM 4A\\n\\n\\tSlowly he pushes the door open, almost afraid at what he\\n\\twill find.  He looks.  Lit by the moonlight through the\\n\\twindow, he can see a FIGURE in the hospital bed alone in the\\n\\troom, and under a transparent oxygen tent.  All that can be\\n\\theard is the steady though strained breathing.  Slowly\\n\\tMICHAEL walks up to it, and is relieved to see his FATHER,\\n\\tsecurely asleep.  Tubes hang from a steel gallows beside the\\n\\tbed, and run to his nose and mouth.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVOICE (O.S.)\\n\\t\\tWhat are you doing here?\\n\\n\\tThis startles MICHAEL; who almost jumps around.  It is a\\n\\tNURSE lit from the light behind her in the hallway.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNURSE\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re not supposed to be here now.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL calms himself, and moves to her.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tI\\'m Michael Corleone--this is my\\n\\t\\tfather.  What happened to the\\n\\t\\tdetectives who were guarding him?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNURSE\\n\\t\\tOh your father just had too many\\n\\t\\tvisitors.  It interfered with the\\n\\t\\thospital service.  The police came\\n\\t\\tand made them all leave just ten\\n\\t\\tminutes ago.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (comfortingly)\\n\\t\\tBut don\\'t worry.  I look in on him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tYou just stand here one minute...\\n\\n\\tQuickly he moves to the telephone, dials a number.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tSonny...Sonny--Jesus Christ, I\\'m\\n\\t\\tdown at the hospital.  I came down\\n\\t\\tlate.  There\\'s no one here.  None\\n\\t\\tof Tessio\\'s people--no detectives,\\n\\t\\tno one.  The old man is completely\\n\\t\\tunprotected.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY (O.S.)\\n\\t\\tAll right, get him in a different\\n\\t\\troom; lock the door from the inside.\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll have some men there inside of\\n\\t\\tfifteen minutes.  Sit tight, and\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t panic.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (furiously, but kept inside)\\n\\t\\tI won\\'t panic.\\n\\n\\tHe hangs up; returns to the NURSE...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNURSE\\n\\t\\tYou cannot stay here...I\\'m sorry.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (coldly)\\n\\t\\tYou and I are going to move my\\n\\t\\tfather right now...to another room\\n\\t\\ton another floor...Can you\\n\\t\\tdisconnect those tubes so we can\\n\\t\\twheel the bed out?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNURSE\\n\\t\\tAbsolutely not!  We have to get\\n\\t\\tpermission from the Doctor.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tYou\\'ve read about my father in the\\n\\t\\tpapers.  You\\'ve seen that no one\\'s\\n\\t\\there to guard him.  Now I\\'ve just\\n\\t\\tgotten word that men are coming to\\n\\t\\tthis hospital to kill him.  Believe\\n\\t\\tme and help me.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNURSE\\n\\t\\t\\t  (frightened)\\n\\t\\tWe don\\'t have to disconnect them,\\n\\t\\twe can wheel the stand with the bed.\\n\\n\\tShe does so...and they perform the very difficult task of\\n\\tmoving the bed and the apparatus, out of the room.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: 4TH FLOOR HOSPITAL (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tThey roll the bed, the stand, and all the tubes silently\\n\\tdown the corridor.  We hear FOOTSTEPS coming up the stairs.\\n\\tMICHAEL hears them, stops.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tHurry, into there.\\n\\n\\tThey push it into the first available room.  MICHAEL peeks\\n\\tout from the door.  The footsteps are louder; then they\\n\\temerge.  It is ENZO, NAZORINE\\'s helper, carrying a bouquet\\n\\tof flowers.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (stepping out)\\n\\t\\tWho is it?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tENZO\\n\\t\\tMichael...do you remember me, Enzo,\\n\\t\\tthe baker\\'s helper to Nazorine, now\\n\\t\\this son-in-law.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tEnzo, get out of here.  There\\'s\\n\\t\\tgoing to be trouble.\\n\\n\\tA look of fear sweeps through ENZO\\'s face.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tENZO\\n\\t\\tIf there...will be trouble...I stay\\n\\t\\twith you, to help.  I owe it to the\\n\\t\\tGodfather.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL thinks, realizes he needs all the help he can get.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tGo outside; stand in front...I\\'ll\\n\\t\\tbe out in a minute.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: DON\\'S SECOND HOSPITAL ROOM (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tThey part.  MICHAEL moves into the hospital room where they\\n\\tput his FATHER.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNURSE\\n\\t\\t\\t  (frightened)\\n\\t\\tHe\\'s awake.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL looks at the OLD MAN, his eyes are open, though he\\n\\tcannot speak.  MICHAEL touches his face tenderly.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tPop...Pop, it\\'s me Michael.  Shhhh,\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t try to speak.  There are men\\n\\t\\twho are coming to try to kill you.\\n\\t\\tBut I\\'m with you...I\\'m with you\\n\\t\\tnow...\\n\\n\\tThe OLD MAN tries to speak...but cannot.  MICHAEL tenderly\\n\\tputs his finger to his FATHER\\'s lips.\\n\\n\\tEXT NITE: DON\\'S HOSPITAL STREET (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tOutside the hospital is empty save for a nervous ENZO,\\n\\tpacing back and forth brandishly the flowers as his only\\n\\tweapon.  MICHAEL exits the hospital and moves to him.  They\\n\\tboth stand under a lamppost in the cold December night.\\n\\tThey are both frightened; MICHAEL gives ENZO a cigarette,\\n\\tlights it.  ENZO\\'s hands are trembling, MICHAEL\\'s are not.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tGet rid of those and look like\\n\\t\\tyou\\'ve got a gun in your pocket.\\n\\n\\tThe windows of the hospital twinkle with Christmas\\n\\tdecorations.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tListen...\\n\\n\\tWe HEAR the sound of a single automobile coming.  MICHAEL\\n\\tand ENZO look with fear in their eyes.  Then MICHAEL takes\\n\\tthe bouquet of flowers and stuffs them under his jacket.\\n\\tThey stand, hands in their pockets.\\n\\n\\tA long low black car turns the corner and cruises by them.\\n\\tMICHAEL\\'s and ENZO\\'s faces are tough, impassive.  The car\\n\\tseems as though it will stop; and then quickly accelerates.\\n\\tMICHAEL and ENZO are relieved.  MICHAEL looks down; the\\n\\tBAKER\\'s hands are shaking.  He looks at his own, and they\\n\\tare not.\\n\\n\\tAnother moment goes by and we can hear the distant sound of\\n\\tpolice sirens.  They are clearly coming toward the hospital,\\n\\tgetting louder and louder.  MICHAEL heaves a sigh of relief.\\n\\n\\tIn a second, a patrol car makes a screaming turn in front of\\n\\tthe hospital; then two more squad cars follow with uniformed\\n\\tPOLICE and DETECTIVES.  He smiles his relief and starts\\n\\ttoward them.  TWO huge, burly POLICEMEN suddenly grab his\\n\\tarms while ANOTHER frisks him.  A massive POLICE CAPTAIN,\\n\\tspattered with gold braid and scrambled eggs on his hat,\\n\\twith beefy red face and white hair seems furious.  This is\\n\\tMcCLUSKEY.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMCCLUSKEY\\n\\t\\tI thought I got all you guinea\\n\\t\\thoods locked up.  Who the hell are\\n\\t\\tyou and what are you doing here?\\n\\n\\tANOTHER COP standing nearby:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCOP\\n\\t\\tHe\\'s clean, Captain.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL studies McCLUSKEY closely.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (quietly)\\n\\t\\tWhat happened to the detectives who\\n\\t\\twere supposed to be guarding my\\n\\t\\tfather?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMCCLUSKEY\\n\\t\\t\\t  (furious)\\n\\t\\tYou punk-hood.  Who the hell are\\n\\t\\tyou to tell me my business.  I\\n\\t\\tpulled them off.  I don\\'t care how\\n\\t\\tmany Dago gangsters kill each other.\\n\\t\\tI wouldn\\'t lift a finger to keep\\n\\t\\tyour old man from getting knocked\\n\\t\\toff.  Now get the hell out of here;\\n\\t\\tget off this street you punk, and\\n\\t\\tstay away from this hospital.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL stands quiet.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll stay until you put guards\\n\\t\\taround my father\\'s room.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMCCLUSKEY\\n\\t\\tPhil, lock this punk up.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA DETECTIVE\\n\\t\\tThe Kid\\'s clean, Captain...He\\'s a\\n\\t\\twar hero, and he\\'s never been mixed\\n\\t\\tup in the rackets...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMCCLUSKEY\\n\\t\\t\\t  (furious)\\n\\t\\tGoddam it, I said lock him up.  Put\\n\\t\\tthe cuffs on him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (deliberately, right\\n\\t\\t\\t  to McCLUSKEY\\'s face,\\n\\t\\t\\t  as he\\'s being handcuffed)\\n\\t\\tHow much is the Turk paying you to\\n\\t\\tset my father up, Captain?\\n\\n\\tWithout any warning, McCLUSKEY leans back and hits MICHAEL\\n\\tsquarely on the jaw with all his weight and strength.\\n\\tMICHAEL groans, and lifts his hand to his jaw.  He looks at\\n\\tMcCLUSKEY; we are his VIEW and everything goes spinning, and\\n\\the falls to the ground, just as we see HAGEN and CLEMENZA\\'S\\n\\tMEN arrive.\\n\\n\\t---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: MALL (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tHIGH ANGLE VIEW of THE CORLEONE MALL.  The gateway now has a\\n\\tlong black car blocking it.  There are more BUTTON MEN\\n\\tstationed more formally; and some of them visibly carrying\\n\\trifles; those of the houses close to the courtyard have MEN\\n\\tstanding by open windows.  It is clear that the war is\\n\\tescalating.  A car pulls up and out get CLEMENZA, LAMPONE,\\n\\tMICHAEL and HAGEN.  MICHAEL\\'s jaw is wired and bandaged.  He\\n\\tstops and looks up at the open window.  We can see MEN\\n\\tholding rifles.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tChrist, Sonny really means business.\\n\\n\\tThey continue walking.  TESSIO joins them.  The various\\n\\tBODYGUARDS make no acknowledgment.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCLEMENZA\\n\\t\\tHow come all the new men?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTESSIO\\n\\t\\tWe\\'ll need them now.  After the\\n\\t\\thospital incident, Sonny got mad.\\n\\t\\tWe hit Bruno Tattaglia four o\\'clock\\n\\t\\tthis morning.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: DON\\'S HALLWAY\\n\\n\\tThey enter the house past the scores of new and strange faces.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: DON\\'S OFFICE (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tSONNY is in the DON\\'s office; he is excited and exuberant.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tI\\'ve got a hundred button men on\\n\\t\\tthe streets twenty-four hours a day.\\n\\t\\tIf Sollozzo shows one hair on his\\n\\t\\tass he\\'s dead.\\n\\n\\tHe sees MICHAEL, and holds his bandaged face in his hand,\\n\\tkiddingly.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tMikey, you look beautiful!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tCut it out.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tThe Turk wants to talk!  The nerve\\n\\t\\tof that son of a bitch!  After he\\n\\t\\tcraps out last night he wants a meet.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tWas there a definite proposal?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tSure, he wants us to send Mike to\\n\\t\\tmeet him to hear his proposition.\\n\\t\\tThe promise is the deal will be so\\n\\t\\tgood we can\\'t refuse.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tWhat about that Tattaglias?  What\\n\\t\\twill they do about Bruno?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tPart of the deal: Bruno cancels out\\n\\t\\twhat they did to my father.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tWe should hear what they have to say.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tNo, no Consiglere.  Not this time.\\n\\t\\tNo more meetings, no more\\n\\t\\tdiscussions, no more Sollozzo\\n\\t\\ttricks.  Give them one message: I\\n\\t\\tWANT SOLLOZZO.  If not, it\\'s all\\n\\t\\tout war.  We go to the mattresses\\n\\t\\tand we put all the button men out\\n\\t\\ton the street.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tThe other families won\\'t sit still\\n\\t\\tfor all out war.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tThen THEY hand me Sollozzo.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tCome ON Sonny, your father wouldn\\'t\\n\\t\\twant to hear this.  This is not a\\n\\t\\tpersonal thing, this is Business.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tAnd when they shot me father...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tYes, even the shooting of your\\n\\t\\tfather was business, not personal...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tNo no, no more advice on how to\\n\\t\\tpatch it up Tom.  You just help me\\n\\t\\twin.  Understood?\\n\\n\\tHAGEN bows his head; he is deeply concerned.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tI found out about this Captain\\n\\t\\tMcCluskey who broke Mike\\'s jaw.\\n\\t\\tHe\\'s definitely on Sollozzo\\'s\\n\\t\\tpayroll, and for big money.\\n\\t\\tMcCluskey\\'s agreed to be the Turk\\'s\\n\\t\\tbodyguard.  What you have to\\n\\t\\tunderstand is that while Sollozzo\\n\\t\\tis guarded like this, he\\'s\\n\\t\\tinvulnerable.  Nobody has ever\\n\\t\\tgunned down a New York Police\\n\\t\\tCaptain.  Never.  It would be\\n\\t\\tdisastrous.  All the five families\\n\\t\\twould come after you Sonny; the\\n\\t\\tCorleone family would be outcasts;\\n\\t\\teven the old man\\'s political\\n\\t\\tprotection would run for cover.  So\\n\\t\\tjust...take that into consideration.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\t\\t  (still fuming)\\n\\t\\tMcCluskey can\\'t stay with the Turk\\n\\t\\tforever.  We\\'ll wait.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tWe can\\'t wait.  No matter what\\n\\t\\tSollozzo say about a deal, he\\'s\\n\\t\\tfiguring out how to kill Pop.  You\\n\\t\\thave to get Sollozzo now.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tThe kid\\'s right.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tWhat about McCluskey?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tLet\\'s say now that we have to kill\\n\\t\\tMcCluskey.  We\\'ll clear that up\\n\\t\\tthrough our Newspaper contacts later.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tGo on Mike.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tThey want me to go to the conference\\n\\t\\twith Sollozzo.  Set up the meeting\\n\\t\\tfor two days from now.  Sonny, get\\n\\t\\tour informers to find out where the\\n\\t\\tmeeting will be held.\\n\\t\\tInsist it has to be a public place:\\n\\t\\ta bar or restaurant at the height\\n\\t\\tof the dinner hour.  So I\\'ll feel\\n\\t\\tsafe.  They\\'ll check me when I meet\\n\\t\\tthem so I won\\'t be able to carry a\\n\\t\\tweapon; but Clemenza, figure out a\\n\\t\\tway to have one planted there for\\n\\t\\tme.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (pause)\\n\\t\\tThen I\\'ll kill them both.\\n\\n\\tEveryone in the room is astonished; they all look at MICHAEL.\\n\\tSilence.  SONNY suddenly breaks out in laughter.  He points\\n\\ta finger at MICHAEL, trying to speak.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSONNY\\n\\t\\tYou?  You, the high-class college\\n\\t\\tkid.  You never wanted to get mixed\\n\\t\\tup in the family business.  Now you\\n\\t\\twanta gun down a police Captain and\\n\\t\\tthe Turk just because you got\\n\\t\\tslapped in the face.  You\\'re taking\\n\\t\\tit personal, it\\'s just business and\\n\\t\\the\\'s taking it personal.\\n\\n\\tNow CLEMENZA and TESSIO are also smiling; only HAGEN keeps\\n\\this face serious.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (angrily, but cold)\\n\\t\\tSonny, it\\'s all personal, and I\\n\\t\\tlearned it from him, the old man,\\n\\t\\tthe Godfather.

Then suddenly it hits the divider,\\n\\ttemporarily lifts into the air, and bounces over into the\\n\\tlanes going back to New York.  It then hits it very fast, on\\n\\tthe way back to the city.\\n\\n\\tEXT NITE: SOLLOZZO\\'S CAR (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO checks to see the cars that had been following, and\\n\\tthen leans to the DRIVER.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tNice work; I\\'ll remember it.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL is relieved.\\n\\n\\tEXT NITE: LUNA AZURA RESTAURANT (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tThe car pulls up in front of a little family restaurant in\\n\\tthe Bronx:  The \"LUNA AZURA\".  There is no one on the street.\\n\\tMICHAEL looks to see if the DRIVER is going to get out with\\n\\tthem.  He gets out, and opens the door.  SOLLOZZO, McCLUSKEY\\n\\tand MICHAEL get out; the DRIVER remains leaning against the\\n\\tcar.  They enter the restaurant.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tA very small family restaurant with a mosaic tile floor.\\n\\tSOLLOZZO, MICHAEL and McCLUSKEY sit around a rather small\\n\\tround table near the center of the room.  There are empty\\n\\tbooths along the side walls; with a handful of CUSTOMERS,\\n\\tand ONE or TWO WAITERS.  It is very quiet.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMCCLUSKEY\\n\\t\\tIs the Italian food good here?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tTry the veal; it\\'s the finest in\\n\\t\\tNew York.\\n\\n\\tThe solitary WAITER brings a bottle of wine to the table.\\n\\tThey watch him silently as he uncorks it and pours three\\n\\tglasses.  Then, when he leaves, SOLLOZZO turns to McCLUSKEY:\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tI am going to talk Italian to Mike.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMCCLUSKEY\\n\\t\\tSure, you two go right ahead; I\\'ll\\n\\t\\tconcentrate on my veal and my\\n\\t\\tspaghetti.\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO now begins in rapid Sicilian.  MICHAEL listening\\n\\tcarefully and nodding every so often.  Then MICHAEL answers\\n\\tin Sicilian, and SOLLOZZO goes on.  The WAITER occasionally\\n\\tbrings food; and they hesitate while he is there; then go on.\\n\\tThen MICHAEL, having difficulty expressing himself in\\n\\tItalian, accidentally lapses into English.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (using English for emphasis)\\n\\t\\tMost important...I want a sure\\n\\t\\tguarantee that no more attempts\\n\\t\\twill be made on my father\\'s life.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tWhat guarantees can I give you?  I\\n\\t\\tam the hunted one.  I\\'ve missed my\\n\\t\\tchance.  You think too highly of\\n\\t\\tme, my friend...I am not so\\n\\t\\tclever...all I want if a truce...\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL looks long and hard at SOLLOZZO, who is smiling\\n\\tholding his open hands up as if to say: \"I have no tricks up\\n\\tmy sleeve\".  Then he looks away and makes a distressed look\\n\\ton his face.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tWhat is it?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tIs it all right if I go to the\\n\\t\\tbathroom?\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO is intuitively suspicious.  He studies MICHAEL with\\n\\this dark eyes.  Then he thrusts his hand onto MICHAEL\\'s\\n\\tthigh feeling in and around, searching for a weapon.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMCCLUSKEY\\n\\t\\tI frisked him; I\\'ve frisked\\n\\t\\tthousands of young punks; he\\'s clean.\\n\\n\\tHe looks at a MAN sitting at a table opposite them;\\n\\tindicating the bathroom with his eyes.  The MAN nods,\\n\\tindicating no one is there.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSOLLOZZO\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t take too long.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL gets up and calmly walks to the bathroom, and\\n\\tdisappears inside.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA TOILET (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL steps into the small bathroom; he is breathing very\\n\\thard.  He actually uses the urinal.  Then he washes his\\n\\thands with the bar of pink soap; and dries them thoroughly.\\n\\tThen he moves to the booth, up to the old-fashioned toilet.\\n\\tSlowly he reaches behind the water tank; he panics when he\\n\\tcannot feel the gun.  We see behind the tank his hand is\\n\\tjust a few inches from the gun...he gropes\\n\\tsearchingly...finally coming to rest on the gun.\\n\\n\\tCLOSE ON MICHAEL; the feel of it reassures him.  Then he\\n\\tbreaks it loose from the tape holding it; he takes a deep\\n\\tbreath and shoves it under his waistband.  For some\\n\\tunexplainable reason he hesitates once again, deliberately\\n\\twashes his hands and dries them.  Then he goes out.\\n\\n\\tINT NITE: LUNA AZURA (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tHe hesitates by the bathroom door; and looks at his table.\\n\\tMcCLUSKEY is eating a plate of spaghetti and veal.  SOLLOZZO\\n\\tturns around upon hearing the door, and looks directly at\\n\\tMICHAEL.  MICHAEL looks back.  Then he smiles and continues\\n\\tback to the table.  He sits down.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tNow I can talk.  I feel much better.\\n\\n\\tThe MAN by the far wall had been stiff with attention; now\\n\\the too relaxes.  SOLLOZZO leans toward MICHAEL who sits down\\n\\tcomfortably and his hands move under the table and unbutton\\n\\this jacket.  SOLLOZZO begins to speak in Sicilian once again\\n\\tbut MICHAEL\\'s heart is pounding so hard he can barely hear\\n\\thim.\\n\\n\\tThe WAITER comes to ask about the order, SOLLOZZO turns to\\n\\tspeak, and without warning, MICHAEL shoves the table away\\n\\tfrom him with his left hand, and with his right hand puts\\n\\tthe gun right against SOLLOZZO\\'s head, just touching his\\n\\ttemple.  He pulls the trigger, and we see part of SOLLOZZO\\'s\\n\\thead blown away, and a spray of fine mist of blood cover the\\n\\tentire area.\\n\\n\\tThe WAITER looks in amazement; suddenly his white jacket is\\n\\tsprayed and stained with blood.\\n\\n\\tSOLLOZZO seems in a perpetual fall to the floor; through he\\n\\tseems to hang in space suspended.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL pivots, and looks:\\n\\n\\tThere is McCLUSKEY, frozen, the fork with a piece of veal\\n\\tsuspended in air before his gaping mouth.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL fires; catching McCLUSKEY in his thick bulging\\n\\tthroat.  He makes a horrible, gagging, choking sound.  Then\\n\\tcoolly, and deliberately, MICHAEL fires again, fires right\\n\\tthrough McCLUSKEY\\'s white-topped skull.\\n\\n\\tThe air is filled with pink mist.\\n\\tMICHAEL swings toward the MAN standing by the bathroom wall.\\n\\tHe does not make a move, seemingly paralyzed.\\n\\tNow he carefully shows his hands to be empty.\\n\\tThe WAITER steps backward through the mist of blood, an\\n\\texpression of horror on his face.\\n\\tMICHAEL looks at his two victims:\\n\\tSOLLOZZO still in his chair, side of his body propped up by\\n\\tthe table.\\n\\tMcCLUSKEY finally falls from the chair to the table.\\n\\tMICHAEL is wildly at a peak.  He starts to move out.  His\\n\\thand: is frozen by his side, STILL GRIPPING THE GUN.\\n\\tHe moves, not letting the gun go.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL\\'s face; frozen in its expression.\\n\\n\\tHis hand: still holding the gun.\\n\\n\\tHis face: finally he closes his eyes.\\n\\n\\tHis hand relaxes, the gun falls to the floor with a dull thud.\\n\\n\\tHe walks quickly out of the restaurant, looks back.\\n\\n\\tHe sees a frozen tableau of the murder; as though it had\\n\\tbeen recreated in wax.\\n\\n\\tThen he leaves.\\n\\n\\t---------------------------------------FADE OUT---------\\n\\n\\tFADE IN:\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: MATTRESS (WINTER 1945)\\n\\n\\tA MAN is his shirtsleeves plays a sentimental tune on an old\\n\\tupright piano, while his cigarette burns on the edge.\\n\\tANOTHER stands nearby, listening quietly.\\n\\n\\tA little distance away, TEN MEN sit around a crude table,\\n\\tquietly eating.

If Don Corleone had all the\\n\\t\\tjudges and politicians in New York,\\n\\t\\tthen he must share them or let\\n\\t\\tothers use them.  Certainly he can\\n\\t\\tpresent a bill for such services,\\n\\t\\twe\\'re not Communists, after all.\\n\\t\\tBut he has to let us draw water\\n\\t\\tfrom the well.  It\\'s that simple.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tMy friends, I didn\\'t refuse out of\\n\\t\\tmalice.  You all know me.  When\\n\\t\\thave I ever refused an accommodation?\\n\\t\\tBut why, this time?  Because I\\n\\t\\tthink this drug business will\\n\\t\\tdestroy us in the years to come.\\n\\t\\tIt\\'s not like whiskey or gambling\\n\\t\\tor even women which most people\\n\\t\\twant and is forbidden them by the\\n\\t\\tpezzonovante of the Church and the\\n\\t\\tGovernment.  But drugs?  No.  Even\\n\\t\\tpolicemen, who help us in gambling\\n\\t\\tand other things would refuse to\\n\\t\\thelp us in drugs.  But...I am\\n\\t\\twilling to do whatever all of you\\n\\t\\tthink is necessary.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON ZALUCHI\\n\\t\\tI don\\'t believe in drugs.  For\\n\\t\\tyears I paid my people extra so\\n\\t\\tthey wouldn\\'t do that kind of\\n\\t\\tbusiness...$200 a week.  But it\\n\\t\\tdidn\\'t matter.  Somebody comes to\\n\\t\\tthem and says, \"I have powders, if\\n\\t\\tyou put up three, four thousand\\n\\t\\tdollar investment, we can make\\n\\t\\tfifty thousand distributing.\"  Who\\n\\t\\tcan resist such a profit?\\n\\t\\tThere\\'s no way to control it, as a\\n\\t\\tbusiness...to keep it respectable.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (rapping the table)\\n\\t\\tI don\\'t want it near schools!  I\\n\\t\\tdon\\'t want it sold to children.\\n\\t\\tThat is an infamita.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (thinking)\\n\\t\\tIn my city I would try to keep the\\n\\t\\ttraffic in the dark people, the\\n\\t\\tcolored.  They are the best\\n\\t\\tcustomers, the least troublesome,\\n\\t\\tand they are animals anyway.  They\\n\\t\\thave no respect for their wives or\\n\\t\\ttheir families or themselves.  Let\\n\\t\\tthem lose their souls with drugs.\\n\\t\\tBut something has to be done, we\\n\\t\\tcan\\'t have everybody running around\\n\\t\\tdoing just what they please, like a\\n\\t\\tbunch of anarchists.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBARZINI\\n\\t\\tThen, are we agreed; the traffic in\\n\\t\\tdrugs will be permitted, but\\n\\t\\tcontrolled; and Don Corleone agrees\\n\\t\\tto give it protection in the East.\\n\\n\\tDON CORLEONE nods.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBARZINI\\n\\t\\tThat\\'s the whole matter then, we\\n\\t\\thave the peace, and let me pay my\\n\\t\\trespects to Don Corleone, whom we\\n\\t\\thave all known over the years as a\\n\\t\\tman of his word.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (noticing TATTAGLIA\\n\\t\\t\\t  is uneasy)\\n\\t\\tDon Philip?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTATTAGLIA\\n\\t\\tI agree to everything here, I\\'m\\n\\t\\twilling to forget my own misfortune.\\n\\t\\tBut I must hear strict assurance\\n\\t\\tfrom Corleone.  When time goes by\\n\\t\\tand his position becomes stronger,\\n\\t\\twill he attempt any individual\\n\\t\\tvengeance?\\n\\n\\tThey all look at the DON; especially HAGEN, who feels that\\n\\tDON CORLEONE has given a great deal, and must have something\\n\\telse in mind.  Slowly the DON rises.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tI forego my vengeance for my dead\\n\\t\\tson, for the common good.  But I\\n\\t\\thave selfish reasons.  My youngest\\n\\t\\tson had to flee, accused of\\n\\t\\tSollozzo\\'s murder, and I must now\\n\\t\\tmake arrangements so that he can\\n\\t\\tcome home with safety, cleared of\\n\\t\\tall those false charges.  That is\\n\\t\\tmy affair, and I will make those\\n\\t\\tarrangements.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (with strength)\\n\\t\\tBut I am a superstitious man...and\\n\\t\\tso if some unlucky accident should\\n\\t\\tbefall my youngest son, if some\\n\\t\\tpolice officer should accidentally\\n\\t\\tshoot him, or if he should hang\\n\\t\\thimself in his cell, or if my son\\n\\t\\tis struck by a bolt of lightning,\\n\\t\\tthen I will blame some of the\\n\\t\\tpeople here.  That, I could never\\n\\t\\tforgive, but...aside from that, let\\n\\t\\tme swear by the souls of my\\n\\t\\tGrandchildren that I will never be\\n\\t\\tthe one to break the peace we have\\n\\t\\tmade.\\n\\n\\tEXT NITE: DON\\'S LIMO (SPRING 1946)\\n\\n\\tThe DON\\'s black limousine.

Further ahead\\n\\tis a villa so Roman it looks as though it had just been\\n\\tdiscovered in the ruins of Pompeii.  There is a group of\\n\\tyoung village GIRLS accompanied by two stocky MATRONS,\\n\\tdressed in black.  They have been gathering the pink sulla,\\n\\tpurple wisteria, and mixing them with orange and lemon\\n\\tblossoms.

Besides,\\n\\t\\tif I ever need any advice, who\\'s a\\n\\t\\tbetter Consigliere than my father.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCLEMENZA\\n\\t\\tThen in a six month time we\\'re on\\n\\t\\tour own; is that it?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tMaybe less...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTESSIO\\n\\t\\tLet us fill up our Regimes.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tNo.  I want things very calm for\\n\\t\\tanother six months.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTESSIO\\n\\t\\tForgive me, Godfather, let our\\n\\t\\tyears of friendship be my excuse.\\n\\t\\tHow can you hope for success there\\n\\t\\twithout your strength here to back\\n\\t\\tyou up?  The two  go hand in hand.\\n\\t\\tAnd with you gone from here the\\n\\t\\tBarzini and the Tattaglias will be\\n\\t\\ttoo strong for us.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCLEMENZA\\n\\t\\tAnd I don\\'t like Barzini.  I say\\n\\t\\tthe Corleone Family has to move\\n\\t\\tfrom strength, not weakness.  We\\n\\t\\tshould build our Regimes and take\\n\\t\\tback our lost territories in Staten\\n\\t\\tIsland, at least.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tDo you have faith in my judgement?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCLEMENZA\\n\\t\\tYes, Godfather...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tThen do what Michael says...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tAll I can say is that things are\\n\\t\\tbeing resolved that are more\\n\\t\\teffective than a thousand buttonmen\\n\\t\\ton the streets.  Understood?\\n\\n\\tThere are uneasy looks all around.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCARLO\\n\\t\\tUnderstood.

They all nod,\\n\\treluctantly.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tAll right, then it\\'s resolved.\\n\\n\\tNERI knows the meeting is over, he opens the Den\\'s door.\\n\\n\\tCLEMENZA and TESSIO pay their respects to the DON and leave,\\n\\tthen CARLO.  NERI watches CARLO as he walks down the\\n\\tcorridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man.\\n\\n\\tThen NERI closes the door.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL relaxes.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tMike, why are you cutting me out of\\n\\t\\tthe action?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tTom, we\\'re going to be legitimate\\n\\t\\tall the way, and you\\'re the legal\\n\\t\\tman.  What could be more important\\n\\t\\tthan that.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tI\\'m not talking about that.  I\\'m\\n\\t\\ttalking about Rocco Lampone building\\n\\t\\ta secret regime.  Why does Neri\\n\\t\\treport directly to you, rather than\\n\\t\\tthrough me or a caporegime?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tI told you that it wouldn\\'t escape\\n\\t\\this eye.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tHow did you find out?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tBookkeepers know everything.\\n\\t\\tRocco\\'s men are all a little too\\n\\t\\tgood for the jobs they\\'re supposed\\n\\t\\tto be doing.

Barzini\\'s a wolf, and\\n\\t\\tif he tears you apart, the other\\n\\t\\tfamilies won\\'t come running to help\\n\\t\\tthe Corleones...\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tTom, I never thought you were a bad\\n\\t\\tConsigliere, I thought Santino a\\n\\t\\tbad Don, rest in peace.  He had a\\n\\t\\tgood heart but he wasn\\'t the right\\n\\t\\tman to head the family when I had\\n\\t\\tmy misfortune.  Michael has all my\\n\\t\\tconfidence, as you do.  For reasons\\n\\t\\twhich you can\\'t know, you must have\\n\\t\\tno part in what will happen.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHAGEN\\n\\t\\tMaybe I can help.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (coldly)\\n\\t\\tYou\\'re out, Tom.\\n\\n\\tTOM pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence.  TOM\\n\\tleaves.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL looks at NERI.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tI\\'m going to talk to my father.\\n\\n\\tNERI nods, and then leaves.  The DON opens the doors,\\n\\tbreathes in the air, and steps outside.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: THE GARDEN (1955)\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tI see you have your Luca Brasi.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll need him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tThere are men in this world who\\n\\t\\tdemand to be killed.  They argue in\\n\\t\\tgambling games; they jump out of\\n\\t\\ttheir cars in a rage if someone so\\n\\t\\tmuch as scratches their fender.\\n\\t\\tThese people wander through the\\n\\t\\tstreets calling out \"Kill me, kill\\n\\t\\tme.\"  Luca Brasi was like that.\\n\\t\\tAnd since he wasn\\'t scared of\\n\\t\\tdeath, and in fact, looked for\\n\\t\\tit...I made him my weapon.  Because\\n\\t\\tI was the only person in the world\\n\\t\\tthat he truly hoped would not kill\\n\\t\\thim.  I think you have done the\\n\\t\\tsame with this man.\\n\\n\\tThey walk through the DON\\'s vegetable garden.  Tomatoes,\\n\\tpeppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting.\\n\\tMICHAEL follows; the DON turns and looks at him.  Then\\n\\tstoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tBarzini will move against you first.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tHow?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDON CORLEONE\\n\\t\\tHe will get in touch with you\\n\\t\\tthrough someone you absolutely\\n\\t\\ttrust.

He lets Michael do all the\\n\\t\\twork.  He just plays the fool with\\n\\t\\this garden, his peppers, his\\n\\t\\ttomatoes, as if he was some peasant\\n\\t\\tstill.  But men are like that...\\n\\n\\tShe stops toward the Church.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMAMA\\n\\t\\tYou come in, too.\\n\\n\\tKAY shakes her head.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMAMA\\n\\t\\tThe Priest ain\\'t gonna bite you\\n\\t\\tcause you\\'re not Catholic.\\n\\t\\t\\t  (whispered)\\n\\t\\tHe\\'s in the back drinkin\\' his wine.\\n\\n\\tKAY laughs and follows MAMA up the steps of the Church.\\n\\tThey enter.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: CHURCH (1955)\\n\\n\\tInside the Church, KAY watches as MAMA blesses herself from\\n\\tthe holy water.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMAMA\\n\\t\\tYou can.\\n\\n\\tTentatively, KAY dips her fingers into the water, and\\n\\tblesses herself.  Then SHE follows MAMA down the aisle, in\\n\\tawe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally\\n\\tthe Altar.\\n\\n\\tMAMA stops by the impressive tiers of candles.  There is a\\n\\tlarge coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting\\n\\tcandles.  MAMA fumbles in her purse for change; KAY gives\\n\\ther some.\\n\\n\\tMAMA drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the\\n\\ttaper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great\\n\\tdignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights\\n\\ttwenty candles.\\n\\n\\tShe finishes, and bows her head.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: BONASERA\\'S FUNERAL HOME\\n\\n\\tVery few people in the streets.  TOTAL SILENCE.  But black\\n\\tflower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks.\\n\\tAn expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous.\\n\\tCertainly no more could be done for a President or a King.\\n\\n\\tEach car carries an elaborate floral decoration.

We cannot see the remains of\\n\\tDon Corleone.\\n\\n\\tBONASERA is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved\\n\\tfamily.  One by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely\\n\\twith grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on.\\n\\n\\tThe VIEW ALTERS,\\n\\n\\tand we see that the line is endless.  JOHNNY FONTANE, tears\\n\\topenly falling, takes his turn.\\n\\n\\tChildren are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last\\n\\tlook at the great man.\\n\\n\\tCLEMENZA whispers into the ear of LAMPONE.  LAMPONE\\n\\timmediately arranges for the members of the Five New York\\n\\tFamilies to pay their respects.\\n\\n\\tFirst CUNEO, then STRACHI and then ZALUCHI.  Then PHILIP\\n\\tTATTAGLIA, who merely passes by the Coffin.\\n\\n\\tThen BARZINI in a black homburg, standing a long time.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL watches the scene.\\n\\n\\tBARZINI crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined\\n\\tby his men.\\n\\n\\tAs BARZINI leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on\\n\\thim; perhaps asking for favors: But at any rate, it is clear\\n\\tfrom the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that\\n\\the is the new Capo di Capi--the place formerly held by Don\\n\\tCorleone.\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL watches silently.\\n\\n\\tBARZINI is searching for somebody with his eyes.  First\\n\\tCLEMENZA.  Then TESSIO.\\n\\n\\tCONNIE rushes into MICHAEL\\'s arms, tears in her eyes.

He\\n\\tfinds him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTESSIO\\n\\t\\tMike, could I have a minute?\\n\\n\\tMIKE; nods; and they move to a private place.

He moves to the window and looks out.\\n\\n\\tWHAT HE SEES:\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: MALL (1955)\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL, still dressed in a dark suit; followed by NERI,\\n\\tLAMPONE and CLEMENZA, then HAGEN.\\n\\n\\tThey move toward us.\\n\\n\\tExcitedly, CARLO moves to the front door; opens it.\\n\\n\\tHe wears a broad smile.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCARLO\\n\\t\\tGodfather!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tYou have to answer for Santino.\\n\\n\\tThe smile on CARLO\\'s face slowly fades, then, in a foolish\\n\\tattempt for safety, he slams the door in their faces and\\n\\tbacks into the living room.\\n\\n\\tINT DAY: CARLO\\'S LIVING ROOM (1955)\\n\\n\\tThe door opens, and the grim party enters.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tYou fingered Sonny for the Barzini\\n\\t\\tpeople.  That little farce you\\n\\t\\tplayed out with my sister.  Did\\n\\t\\tBarzini kid you that would fool a\\n\\t\\tCorleone?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCARLO\\n\\t\\t\\t  (dignity)\\n\\t\\tI swear I\\'m innocent.  I swear on\\n\\t\\tthe head of my children, I\\'m\\n\\t\\tinnocent.  Mike, don\\'t do this to\\n\\t\\tme, please Mike, don\\'t do this to me!\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (quietly)\\n\\t\\tBarzini is dead.  So is Philip\\n\\t\\tTattaglia, so are Strachi, Cuneo\\n\\t\\tand Moe Greene...I want to square\\n\\t\\tall the family accounts tonight.\\n\\t\\tSo don\\'t tell me you\\'re innocent;\\n\\t\\tadmit what you did.\\n\\n\\tCARLO is silent; he wants to talk but is terrified.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (almost kindly)\\n\\t\\tDon\\'t be frightened.  Do you think\\n\\t\\tI\\'d make my sister a widow?  Do you\\n\\t\\tthink I\\'d make your children\\n\\t\\tfatherless?  After all, I\\'m\\n\\t\\tGodfather to your son.  No, your\\n\\t\\tpunishment is that you\\'re out of\\n\\t\\tthe family business.  I\\'m putting\\n\\t\\tyou on a plane to Vegas--and I want\\n\\t\\tyou to stay there.  I\\'ll send\\n\\t\\tConnie an allowance, that\\'s all.\\n\\t\\tBut don\\'t keep saying you\\'re\\n\\t\\tinnocent; it insults my intelligence\\n\\t\\tand makes me angry.  Who approached\\n\\t\\tyou, Tattaglia or Barzini?\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCARLO\\n\\t\\t\\t  (sees his way out)\\n\\t\\tBarzini.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\t\\t  (softly)\\n\\t\\tGood, good.  Leave now; there\\'s a\\n\\t\\tcar waiting to take you to the\\n\\t\\tairport.\\n\\n\\tCARLO moves to the door; opens it.  There is a car waiting;\\n\\twith a group of MEN around it.\\n\\n\\tHe looks back at MICHAEL, who reassures him.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMICHAEL\\n\\t\\tI\\'ll call your wife and tell her\\n\\t\\twhat flight you\\'re on.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: MALL\\n\\n\\tCARLO moves out to the Mall; the BUTTONMEN are putting his\\n\\tthings in the trunk.\\n\\n\\tONE opens the front door for him.\\n\\n\\tSOMEONE is sitting in the rear seat, though we cannot see who.\\n\\n\\tCARLO gets into the car; out of nervousness, he looks back\\n\\tto see the other man.\\n\\n\\tIt is CLEMENZA, who nods cordially.\\n\\n\\tThe motor starts, and as the car pulls away, CLEMENZA\\n\\tsuddenly throws the garrote around CARLO\\'s neck.  He chokes\\n\\tand leaps up like a fish on a line, kicking his feet.\\n\\n\\tThe garrote is pulled tighter; CARLO\\'s face turns color.\\n\\n\\tHis thrashing feet kick right through the front windshield.\\n\\n\\tThen the body goes slack.\\n\\n\\tCLEMENZA makes a foul face, and opens the window as the car\\n\\tdrives off.\\n\\n\\tEXT DAY: CARLO\\'S STEPS (1955)\\n\\n\\tMICHAEL and his party.
